### Bomberjam AI

Write your bot using one of six languages (C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python and PHP) and fight against other players to reach the first place in the leaderboard.

Looks difficult? Don't worry, there is a starter kit and a guide so that anyone at any level can participate. [Check out the guide and the starter kit here](https://bomberjam.anthonysimmon.com/). Hope you enjoye it!



### The Rules Are:

1. You will need to follow the instructions above to build your project.

2. **You have until June 30th at 11:59pm EST** to submit your project (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message:  *-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"* . The bot will listen for the command and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded.

4. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and create something unique. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 

## Submissions:

Student Submissions will be posted here at the end of the challenge:



## One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all of our challenges, there is zero benefit or monetary gain we receive from it. This is just our way of extending the classroom and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of the courses.**
